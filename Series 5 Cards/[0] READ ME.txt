I ripped these files from the game, they aren't rips from the actual cards. 
There may be subtle differences in these files than a real rip, but these work in game which was my only goal.
They may not work in some tag writing apps because the app developers haven't added these amiibos to their list yet.
I haven't tested ALL of these files, but I'm 96% confident that they're all correct.
